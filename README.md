# ESP8266-Network-Owl-Reader
An ESP8266/Arduino receives a UDP multicast packet broadcast by a Network Owl and displays the (XML) data on an
ILI9341 TFT display, using a graph that auto scales, it also displays the time that the UDP packet was received.
The project demonstrates many facets of Arduino/ESP programming.
